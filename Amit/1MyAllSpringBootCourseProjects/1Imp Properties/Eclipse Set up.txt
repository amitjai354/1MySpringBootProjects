just search setuop maven on eclip[se... can download from eclipse marketplace or by providing maven url..

i just imp[ortefd project and it automaticaslly asked me to download maven plugins and install software.


First time open maven maven project.. it will install swome plgin and software by default.. leave for some time
When open project(maven).. leave for some time, it will try to download all the depemndencies.

if not resolving dependencies.. gop to project tab then click update then check force update then ok.. it willl forcely download dependencies... otherewise due to slow connection does not downloads dependeniesc.

******************

uninstall eclipse.. delete .eclipse and eclipse folders in users folder and normally eclipse folder is also in users folder but i have kept that in c program files.. so delete from there
