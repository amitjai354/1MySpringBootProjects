	//in question paper table, it was written: Casual hoodie.. but in json and test case written: Casual Hoodie
	//this is handled by ignoreCase but space issue is not handled..
	//in paper, S, M, L,XL but in test case S, M, L, XL   so this space thing can not ignore..
	//so if in my db stored : S, M, L,XL  
	//but in get api when try to match it has: S, M, L, XL 
	//so test case will fail... even after doing everything right..
	
	
	//so it is best to write long lines from test cases directly.. instead of typing each thing manuallly.. it took
	//my lots of time.. 
	
	//do not forget this.. must open test cases.. you do not open test cases ever in exam hall.. first thing is read
	//paper and then open test cases..
	
	//copy paste here from test cases...
